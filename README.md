This is an Android app used to read and write to Bluetooth Low Energy (BT Smart) devices.

When you open the app on your phone or tablet, it will automatically search for nearby BLE devices.
Any devices that it finds will be displayed in a list. Click on one of the devices to initiate a BLE connection.

Once you've connected the app will interogate the BLE device and discover services. Click on a service to expand it and view any of its characteristics.
If you click on a characteristic, the app will read its value from the device.
If you long-click on a characteristic, the app will allow you to write to the characteristic if you have permission.
